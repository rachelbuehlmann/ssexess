>Their realism dismantles „pornography“ like Ballard‘s text: as a series of fragmentary, alienated, passionless responses to a set of stimuli. A penis inside a moith takes on the detached distancing of a medical lecture, its eroticism excised - just as an atrocity on the news is neutralized by the commercial that follows, resulting in deadend emotional response.
(V. Vale)

„HARDEST CORE PORN“

„The nonsexual roots of sexuality are explored with a surgeon‘s precision. (...) The line between inner and outer landscape is breaking down. Earthquakes can result from seismic upheavals within the human mind. The whole random universe of the industrial age is breaking down into cryptic fragments. (...) The human body becomes landscape and the maginification of this image turns it into something unrecognizable.“
(aus dem Vorwort von William S. Burroughs)
